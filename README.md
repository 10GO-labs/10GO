## Project Overview

10GO is a decentralized platform designed to onboard users from traditional payment systems like Mercado Pago into the world of crypto. By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs for decentralized settlement and account abstraction, 10GO simplifies the transition to crypto for new users, while laying the foundation for future features like collateralized lending and microcredits.

## Repository Structure

- **[Front-end Code](https://github.com/10GO-labs/10GO-frontend)**: Source code for the front-end application.
- **[Smart Contract Code](https://github.com/10GO-labs/10GO-contracts)**: Smart contract for the escrow, enabling decentralized settlements, deployed [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xbc9cA80364f4bbF56211768519db012F0A76aee2#code).
- **[ZK Circuits Code](https://github.com/yagopajarino/zk-email-minimal)**: Zero-knowledge circuits for transaction validation. Implementation of the zk email library to demonstrate a proof of knowledge from a cryptographically signed email.

## How It Works

1. **Onboarding**: Users create crypto wallets linked to their Mercado Pago email, using account abstraction for a seamless transition to DeFi.
2. **Decentralized Settlement**: Zero-knowledge proofs ensure secure, decentralized fund transfers between fiat and crypto.
3. **Future Features**: 10GO will support collateralized lending and microcredits.

## About

**10GO** is an open-source project developed by [Nicolás Biondini](https://github.com/NicolasBiondini), [Yago Pajariño](https://github.com/yagopajarino), [Alejandro Almaraz](https://github.com/almaraz97) and [Arturo Beccar-Varela](https://github.com/arturoBeccar). With expertise in blockchain, cryptography, front-end development and financial risk management, we aim to bring trust and privacy to financial transactions. 

We joined this hackathon as students of the [PSE Core Program](https://pse.dev/en/programs), eager to make a real-world impact with programmable cryptography.
